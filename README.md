# mda-effects
The "mda" audio processing plug-ins were available for many years as closed-source freeware from [Maxim Digital Audio](http://mda.smartelectronix.com). They were developed by Paul Kellett, and open-sourced to [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mda-vst/) in 2015.

This repository is based on the code published on SourceForge.

## Requires VST2 SDK

These plug-ins were written using the original VST 2.4 SDK from [Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH](https://www.steinberg.net/), which is no longer available, and Steinberg has ceased issuing licenses for it. As a result, this code is only directly usable if you happen to have a copy of the SDK, and can only be distributed if you happen to have secured a license from Steinberg prior to October 2018.

However, all of the code is simple enough that porting it to newer plug-in SDKs should be quite simple.

## Unify licensing status

The updated versions of the mda plug-ins, compiled from the code in this GitHub repo, are bundled with [Unify](https://www.pluginguru.com/products/unify-standard/), a product developed by [Shane Dunne & Associates, Inc.](https://getdunne.com/) and distributed by [PlugInGuru](https://www.pluginguru.com/). Shane Dunne & Associates, Inc. is licensed to distribute VST 2.4 compatible plug-ins.
