# mda-effects
The "mda" audio processing plug-ins were available for many years as closed-source freeware from [Maxim Digital Audio](http://mda.smartelectronix.com). They were developed by Paul Kellett, and open-sourced to [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mda-vst/) in 2015.

This repository is based on the code published on SourceForge.
